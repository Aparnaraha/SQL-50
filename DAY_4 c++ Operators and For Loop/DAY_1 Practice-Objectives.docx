Solution Description
Even though you get the output as '2', you'll also get a "division by zero" warning. The reason you only get a 
warning but not an error is short-circuit evaluation. In the if statement, once the first condition (x != 10) is 
evaluated to be false, then the second condition (x / 0 == 0) is not even executed because the result of the overall 
condition (x != 10 && x / 0 == 0) will be false. Even if the second condition were true, it would not change the overall 
result of the two conditions.

However, if the value of x or the first condition itself is changed so that it evaluates to true, then you will get 
an error because in that case the second condition would also be checked (or executed).
