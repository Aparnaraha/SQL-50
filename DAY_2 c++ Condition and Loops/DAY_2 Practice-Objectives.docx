Hello
Hi
Hello Hi 
Hello Hey
Correct Answer
Solution Description
First if condition is true, so "Hello " will be printed. After that, next if condition will 
be evaluated (as both if's are independent if's) which is again true. Hence, next "Hi " will be printed 
(obviously in same line). We won't go inside else, as if is already executed.

Inside if
15
Inside if Inside else if 15
Inside if 15 
Correct Answer
Solution Description
The condition inside if is true, hence statement "Inside if" will be printed. After that, we'll directly jump to 
statement : cout << x. So, after that 15 will be printed.

Correct Answer
Solution Description
Inside if condition, we are doing if((var2 = 1) == var1), So first 1 will be assigned to var2 and then it'll be 
compared with var1. Before comparison, var2 = 1 and var1 = 5, which are not equal. So, we'll move to else part and 
there the value of (var2 + 1) i.e. 2 will be printed.

0 and all negative values
0 and -1
0, all negative values, all positive values except 1
0 
Correct Answer
Solution Description
The if-statement block is only not executed when the value of x is  0. For all other values, it will be treated as true.

    }
    else {
        cout << "hey" << endl;
    }
}
Answer
hello
Type here
Correct Answer
Solution Description
In if condition, we are using logical OR operator ("||"). So if even one condition is true, final answer will be true.

    else if(c >= a && c >= b) {
        cout << "hi";
    }
    else {
        cout << "hey";
    }
}
Answer
hi
Type here
Correct Answer
Solution Description
a <= b evaluates to true, but !b evaluates to false (! operator negates the value, b is non-zero and hence !b becomes 0 which is false).
For AND operator ("&&"), all the condition must be true. So we'll move to else if condition which evaluates to be true as both 
conditions (c >= a and c >= b) are true. Hence, "hi" will be printed.
